# DISCORD GAMES BOT
Python bot that utilizes <b><i>pyautogui</i></b> module to control the mouse and keyboard
in order to play some discord-bot games( [Pokeverse](https://poke-verse.com) and 
[Dank Memer](https://dankmemer.lol) currently) by automatically entering commands
and responding to events as they unfold in real-time.

## REQUIREMENTS:
- Install [pyautogui](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyAutoGui) module and possibly read the 
[documentation](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.org) to understand how it works.
- Need to have a [Discord](https://discord.com) account.
- Need to have a [Discord](https://discord.com) server.
- Need to have <b>specific channels</b> in server for bot to use.

## DISCLAIMERS:
- This bot was created for <b>educational purposes</b> of course :) and definitely not to <i>gain an
unfair advantage</i> over other players; and using it in the discord game bots' servers involved could get you banned
from them. I will <b>not be responsible</b> for any negative events that happen to you in your
use of this bot. Use it wisely.
- The bot was tailored to satisfy my needs and you may need to change some values
like DISPLAY_REGION, or how the bot switches channels to suit your use of discord.
(Few updates will come later to make this process easier.)
- Bot will need to be updated when the discord bot games([Pokeverse](https://poke-verse.com) and 
[Dank Memer](https://dankmemer.lol)) 
also issue updates to events so watch out.
- Bot may need to be babysat as some events from the discord games bots occur too fast  and often get 
out of the display region for this bot to keep track of... but assuredly, this bot can capture 90% of events
 and respond correctly to them.
 Also, the discord games bots sometimes lag and even discord itself lags, and if this bot is not stopped, you might
 end up getting rate-limited.
The 10% ignored and other minor mistakes from the bot should help in making it look like
a human is performing the operations and make your account less suspicious ;)

### PS:
- Pokeverse sends out random captchas which you will have to do yourself otherwise
you won't be able to use any pokeverse commands.
- The bot is in its early stages and may still have some bugs here and there. Feel free to contact
 me if you encounter any problems or are unclear about something: <i>tpandivine48@gmail.com</i>
